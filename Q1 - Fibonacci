#to complete the task we need to create a function "Fibonacci(n)" that will return the first n numbers of Fibonacci sequence
#we state the name of the function and use "{" to start writing the function
Fibonacci=function(n) {
	#as far as if n=1 function will not sum anything, we need to define that case specifically using "if" and write the command after "{"
		if(n==1) {
			#expression to set x equal to 1 under the condition above
			x=1
			#closing the expression with "}" and adding one more expression using "else"
			} else {
				#we are telling R that if n is not equal to one then x is a vector of 1 and 1 OR
				x=c(1,1)
				#we are adding a loop "while" which has a condition that length of vector x should be less then n
				while (length(x)<n) {
					#if condition if fulfilled then we write the expression, assigning the value to the position as a length of x vector
					position=length(x)
					#we create new object basically like that sum of two numbers according to the position of x
					new=x[position]+x[position-1]
					#we state that x as a vector of all values x adding new value to the vector every time
					x=c(x,new)
					#closing the expression with "}"
					}
					#closing the expression with "}"

					#telling R to print vector x
					return(x)
